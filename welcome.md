## I'm working on novel high-throughput approaches to understand and engineer the immune system.

*What if we could design and test the functions of millions of synthetic DNA sequences in human cells?* Our understanding of how genomes control biological function is limited by our ability to make modifications and test hypotheses. As it becomes cheaper to both chemically synthesize DNA and to read from cells with next-generation sequencing, we can identify relationships between DNA sequences and cellular outcomes at an unprecedented scale. This large amount of high-dimensional data can combined with advancements in artificial intelligence that can both rapidly interpret and generate new sequences to test. I'm currently applying these high-throughput synthetic approaches to engineer T cells for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease.
